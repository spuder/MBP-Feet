  3d printable replacement feet for a macbook pro

  ## Installation

  - Print out 4 feet at high detail in TPU
  - Use E600 Glue or similar

  Its better to use too much glue than not enough. E600 glue dries to a rubber cement like consistency. If there is too much glue you can always peal away excess
